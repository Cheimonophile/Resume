          CSE 325: <b>Embedded Microprocessor Systems</b> A+
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Learned about the fundamentals of embedded microprocessor system design and programming, including various forms of digital/analog conversion, hardware interrupts, hardware timing, and external device communication.</li>
          <li>Final Project: Built a simple, autonomous robot with a FRDM-KL46Z microprocessor and programmed it to navigate physical and color-coded mazes. Used external devices including PWM controlled motors with Hall sensors for speed/direction awareness, ultrasonic sensor with timing-based, GPIO communication, PWM servo (to turn the ultrasonic sensor), black/white ADC sensors, and an I2C color sensor.</li>
          <li>As an extension of the project, I attached an I2C Wii Nunchuk controller to the robot so that I could drive it around manually.</li>
