          CSE 534: <b>Advanced Computer Networks</b> A
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Learned about various network architectures not used in the traditional Internet protocol stack such as named-data networks, with a focus on Future Internet Architectures and implementation details with SDN technologies such as OpenFlow and P4.</li>
          <li>Explored various networking testbeds currently deployed around the world, including FABRIC and SLICES, as well as their objectives and architectures.</li>
          <li>Gained experience developing on FABRIC, a national research testbed.</li>
          <li>Final Project: Designed and implemented a prototype for a networking protocol that could abstract L3 network traffic with many benefits including security and the ability to support multiple Internet Architectures simultaneously on the same network hardware.</li>

          CSE 325: <b>Embedded Microprocessor Systems</b> A+
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Learned about the fundamentals of embedded microprocessor system design and programming, including various forms of digital/analog conversion, hardware interrupts, hardware timing, and external device communication.</li>
          <li>Final Project: Built a simple, autonomous robot with a FRDM-KL46Z microprocessor and programmed it to navigate physical and color-coded mazes. Used external devices including PWM controlled motors with Hall sensors for speed/direction awareness, ultrasonic sensor with timing-based, GPIO communication, PWM servo (to turn the ultrasonic sensor), black/white ADC sensors, and an I2C color sensor.</li>
          <li>As an extension of the project, I attached an I2C Wii Nunchuk controller to the robot so that I could drive it around manually.</li>

          <li>Learned about network architecture, protocols, and security, socket programming, flow and congestion control, and link-layer technologies.</li>
          <li>Projects: Built a simple client-server application that encrypted data and a wget clone that operated at the TCP layer rather than the HTTP layer.</li>

          <li>Learned about many different ways to model human languages and how to use them, including n-gram modelling, part-of-speech tagging, syntax parsing, semantic role labelling, and semantic word embeddings.</li>
          <li>Used knowledge from class to build models that can detect the language of a particular text and to analyze differences in word usage from different sources.</li>
